# pts-test-profiles-patches
This repository stores the fixes and patches for the tests available in Phoronix Test Suite for NetBSD and used by the test-profiles featured in [pts-test-profiles-dev](https://github.com/apurvanandan1997/pts-test-profiles-dev/)

This is repository and [pts-test-profiles-dev](https://github.com/apurvanandan1997/pts-test-profiles-dev/) will contain the PTS test profiles and patches that I would develop/debug in GSoC 2020 for The NetBSD Foundation.

These patches are fetched by the test-profiles in [pts-test-profiles-dev](https://github.com/apurvanandan1997/pts-test-profiles-dev/) during runtime and applied. So follow the ```README.md``` of [pts-test-profiles-dev](https://github.com/apurvanandan1997/pts-test-profiles-dev/) to make use of these patches.
